# Custom Python Modules

## General use custom python packages for school and personal projects
<br>

Modules used throughout these custom packaces are:<br>
`numpy, scipy, pandas, os, time, shutli, termcolor`<br>
Make sure these are installed on your computer.

<br>
Download all the folders and files, then run the script `See_Info.py` to see available functions and docstring,
<br><br>

I initially started to create these modules as I notice myself repeating a lot of code throughout my school work and projects. Hope you find them as useful as I do!
