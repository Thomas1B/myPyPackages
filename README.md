# Custom Python Modules

## General use custom python packages for school and personal projects
<br>

Modules used throughout these custom packaces are:<br>
`numpy, scipy, pandas, os, time, shutli, termcolor`

<br>
Follow the example below to see available functions in a given module.
 <br> Example Below:<br>

```py
from myPyPackages import main

main.showModule(module_name)

# Prints available functions, then use

module_name.function? # to see the functions docstring.
```
<br>

I initially started to create these modules as I notice myself repeating a lot of code throughout my school work and projects. Hope you find them as useful as I do!
